# Script to Install Jenkins

This script automates the installation of Java 17 and Jenkins on Debian-based Linux or macOS systems. It first detects the operating system type (Debian or macOS) and installs the appropriate packages using system-specific package managers (apt for Debian and brew for macOS). The script ensures the prerequisites are installed, adds the Jenkins repository (for Debian), and then installs the necessary software. This makes it easier to set up the environment for Jenkins by automating repetitive installation tasks.
